# About
This is going to be my first project and I am really happy to be working on it. As the title suggests this application is generating a random password and it stores it in a database.

# Objectives
_My_ goal is to create my first project and to be able to manage and work on it (by improving it as much as possible).

The project's objectives are:
1. Being able to generate and store strong passwords safely in a database.
2. To secure the passwords by adding a login form.
3. To make the user interaction a nice experience.
