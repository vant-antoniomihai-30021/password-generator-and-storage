# password-generator-and-storage

# About
This is going to be my first project and I am really happy to be working on it. As the title suggests this application is generating a random password and it stores it in a database.

(I still have to decide how to design the application, so I am sorry if this looks bad at this moment)

(Sorry for the general aspect of this one as well)

# Built with 
- Java Spring Boot
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PostgreSQL (for storing)

# Objectives
_My_ goal is to create my first project and to be able to manage and work on it (by improving it as much as possible).

The project's objectives are:
1. Being able to generate and store strong passwords safely in a database.
2. To secure the passwords by adding a login form.
3. To make the user interaction a nice experience.
4. Improve every time I find something that can be improved.

# Improvements over time
* A little bit of the aspect (about border and colors)
* More user-friendly environment (when you add or remove a password it would automatically show the change)
* Added the method to be able to add your own password
* Added some tests for the REST API
  - for the password class
  - for the repository
  - for the service layer
  - for the controller
* Added the button that copies the password to clipboard
  - with a color transition when it is clicked

# Why web application
I actually thought about a GUI program, but in the past I've worked a little bit with web development (only front-end) and I really enjoyed it. The problem was that I had no experience with back-end and no idea where to start. Then at university I was introduced to Java. I liked every aspect about it and I learned it quite fast (since I already knew C and C++ to some degree). That was when I realized that I want to know more about Java. After learning other aspects that I didn't know about, I've decided to choose the path _web application_ with Spring Boot (since I already knew some HTLM, CSS and JavaScript) and here we are.
